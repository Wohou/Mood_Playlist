# Mood_Playlist
## [Personal PROJECT]

Playlist generator based on the mood of the sounds, duration and other parameters with youtube and spotify Oauth.


## [WIP]
- Spotify Oauth still not working.
- When not connected the playlist select from a predefined song pool.
- The Youtube Oauth work for me but will not work for other since I only put my email for the user test on google Oauth settings.
